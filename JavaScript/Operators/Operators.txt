Operators are used to peformining specific mathematic task.
Types:
Arthimatic Operators
Assignment Operators
Comparsion Operators
Logical Operators
Bitwise Operators

Arthimatic Operators:
Used for mathimatical calcuation like add(+),sub(-),mul(*),div(/),remainder(%),exponenation(**)
Increment(++)->> ++x it will Increment value by 1 and prints new value.
Increment(++)->> x++ it will prints the x value and the Increment value by 1. 
Decerment(--)->> --x it will Decrement value by 1 and prints new value.
Decrement(--)->> x-- it will prints the x value and the Decrement value by 1.


Assignment operators(=):
Used for assign the value of variabes.

Comparsion Operators:
Used to compare values and results will be Boolean(true of false).
Realtional Operators:
Greater than(>)
Greater than of equal(>=) 
Less than(>)
Less than of equal(<=)

Equality Operators:
Equal to(===) or Not Equal to (!==).

=== is known Strict equality operator it results true when both type and values are same.

== is known as Lose equality operator it does not caompare the types it will check the values are same.


Conditonal or Ternary Operators(?:)
which evaluates either of two expression (ie.. true of false)
Syntax:
Condtion ? True : False

Logical Operators:
Used to make decision based on multiple Conditonal.
It can be used for Boolean and Non-Boolean values.

Logical AND(&&)--> Returns true-->if both operands are equal else Returns false.
Logical OR(||)--> Returns true-->if any one of the operands are equal else Returns false.
Logical NOT(!)--> It converts True to False or vice-versa.

Bitwise Operators
works at bit level after converting operands to binary format.
Bitwise AND(&)--> Returns 1-->if both operands have 1 else Returns 0
Bitwise OR(|)--> Returns 1-->if any one of the operands have 1 else Returns 0.
